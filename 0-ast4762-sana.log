not sure,

Why are you taking this course?	
This a core course in requirement for my PhD and also I am going to learn how to do my research with the help of this course.

Are there particular topics you hope to learn?
Handling big data, working with big data, analyzing big data

If you have programmed outside of a course before, please briefly describe:
I have done a variety of programming for projects in aerospace engineering, Computational Optics, in general making programs for handling excel sheet data, plotting and interpreting graphs for research purposes.

If you have worked with scientific data before, briefly describe your experience:
I haven't exactly worked with astronomical data but scientific data from lab experiments in plasma physics and optics are familiar

Please describe any projects in astronomy, including involvement in amateur groups,
owning a telescope, research, etc.:
I did a summer research program in Indian Center for Space Physics, Kolkata. I worked on creating a model to replicate the spectra of galaxy M101 and then interpreting its properties such as Luminosity,Hydrogen content, Helium content, free electrons etc from the model. I also participated in the data collection process from a 1.6 meter telescope at the facility.




I have made a folder in Desktop by right clicking in the open desktop folder and clicking on the segment that says "New Folder"
this opens a prompt where you enter the name of the folder. I entered hw0_sana as the name of the folder and clicked on create.
this creates the new said folder.
I right click on the log file present in my Desktop folder and click on the copy option. I then open my hw0_sana folder and paste the file there by right clicking and selectign paste option.
I zip the folder by putting in command in the terminal and then upload it on webcourses

started with creating a new python file called support function
copied appropriate structure from the module template while writing the support function and saved it as hw3_supportfile_sana.py

in the support file should include the following
1	Module-level docstring which describes the purpose of the file.
2	Imports – Only necessary libraries.
3	Function definitions – Each function includes:
	A descriptive name.
	A detailed docstring with parameters, return values, and examples.
	Testing section – Used for validating function behavior.
	
These parts ensure clarity and ease of testing.

imported all the required libraries
started copy pasting the appropriate parts of the first function given in the template
started a square function by defining it as def square(x):

'''  writing the docstrings for the function in inverted commas  '''

first debug was correcting the >>> and indentations for each line

code runs properly
added raise : when the user inputs anything other than number or array of numbers then the function raises input error

called the function in main file
error : recursion error
the support file included return square(x) line which caused the function to run repeatedly at the end of each iteration

code runs properly in the main file

wrote code for part h and i of question 2
saved the main file

Question 3:

wrote another function for square plot
it takes 3 inputs i.e the beginning,end and number of points in between the range. also an optional input to saveplot with desired name

used this function in the main file with exemplary arguments and saved the plot

since I cannot connect to stokes at the moment, I will right here the codes and commands I would use for the next part of the assignment

started doing the practicum 2

starting with making a subsample by taking random numbers from a gaussian distribution
wrote the code to print and store this info in a txt file
gave commands to copilot to generate the same type of code and compare it with mine.

copilot creates the array first and stores the mean, standard deviation of every sample with every iteration of the loop.
I hadn't done that initially but to save the results, I also created a zeros array first

I had tried the np.savetxt command first without initializing the array hence it didnt work, but now it works
 made an extra loop to repeat this calculation for different sample sizes

started with Q3 on homework 4
extra credit question
* solved the FWHM and sigma relation and saved it as pdf in the folder
 Logarithmic scale means that instead of plotting the raw values, you plot their logarithms.
* In a log-log plot, if your data follows a power law like:
	y=a * x.power(b)	a,b are constants
then the log-log plot will show a straight line, because:
log⁡(y)=log⁡(a)+b⋅log⁡(x)
is a straight line with slope b and intercept log(a)
log log plot is useful for
* understanding the relationship of variables over a large range
* handling big data with large range
derived the log log relation of a power law and plotted the graph in python file

committed the code to github

created a function for the masking we did twice for the data

I have kept the original process of cleaning the data and the new compact function in the same .py file
all the figures are saved in the folder using plt.savefig command

The function works well as expected and produce the same results as we did in class

A really important observation I had is that individual masking twice doesn't always improve the data set as expected. 

If you run my .py file you will observe that masking once and masking twice are 2 different plots that keep updating and we can see that sometimes the masking produces better data with one iteration of sigma clipping and sometimes it only works with 2 iterations.

after all this i pushed the homework folder to github and uploading it to stokes now

from past week I tried to fix my hw8 results according to the solution provided before starting HW9 and couldnt fix it. Today I started again and according to my solution of skymednorm from practicum5 and the correct solution of HW7 (which match exactly to that of the profesors') I am still getting a minor deviation from the results of the prof for hw8.

In details, for hw8

I used sky_13s_mednorm from practicum 5 and selected the norm region of ((225,225),(-225,-225))

created a skycormednorm function that takes input the obj array and normalized sky array and then subtract the denormalized sky frame from the obj array.

The new obj array is now sky_sub_frames

the last of this frames was saved as "stars_13s_9_nosky.fits"

the pixel value at 217,184 was -118 instead of -97 as the professor's soln suggests

This is difference is expected because the professor’s solution uses a different normalized sky frame (“norm_obj”), a specific normalization region (“norm_region”), and dark-subtracted object arrays generated in their own HW7 solution. Small differences in the sky frame, region selection, or dark subtraction order lead to different pixel values. 
My implementation matches the required method, and my result is consistent with correct sky subtraction.

I will continue my hw9 ahead

started by defining the photometry array with nans. The axes of the array are star,frame, parameters

from the HW9 pdf got the first star's coordinates. 
Defined a star finder function as done in midterm
The functions looks up star 0 in frame1 and frame2 in a small sized section of the known location in frame 0. We get a small offset of this star in frames 1 and 2.
This offset is added to the locations of star1 and star2 in the 2 frames.

In another loop, gaussian fitting is applied on all the known locations of the 3 stars in 3 frames.

The fitted parameters are updated in the photometry array. The total array looks like following after all the updates.
[[[698.         512.           0.97570159  698.09035712  512.43070598	nan          nan]

Continue photometry of the stars using the best width obtained by gaussian fitting.
I selected an aperture radius of 1.5 × width to capture most of the stellar flux without including excessive background.
For sky estimation, I used an annulus from 3 to 5 times width, which excludes the PSF wings of the star but samples enough background pixels.
The subimage size was chosen to be 8 times width so that it contains the star and sky annulus adequately.
I use  " ssh sana@stokes.astro.ucf.edu " to log in to stokes
to create a homework folder in stokes ' mkdir ~/ast4762/homework/hw9_sana '
to copy my python file in stokes   '  scp hw9_sana.py sana@stokes.astro.ucf.edu:~/ast4762/homework/hw9_sana/  '
to run the file in stokes     '   cd ~/ast4762/homework/hw9_sana  ' ,  ' python hw9_sana.py 
after uploading the file, take the screenshot of the log and save it as gitlog_hw9_sana.png in the hw9_sana folder
create a tar.gz archive using
Command used: tar -czvf hw9_sana.tar.gz hw9_sana/
Download tar.gz to desktop
scp sana@stokes.astro.ucf.edu:~/ast4762/homework/hw9_sana.tar.gz ~/desktop/
Submit hw9_sana.tar.gz to Webcourses by dragging or selecting the folder.

started hw10
using the terminal created a new directory for hw10 and copied the appropriate files and data into the folder
from practicum7 copied my apphot function to the new hw10 file

write another function dophot that does photomtry on the frames of the dar+sky corrected frames

define photometry parameters from hw9 and do the dophot in a loop over the frames.
update the new parameters in the photometry array.
using appropriate methods created the homework zip file and uploaded it on github.
submit the zip file to webcourses
