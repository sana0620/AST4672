no

Will you be attending the DPS conference this year, or will you be away otherwise?	
not sure,

Why are you taking this course?	
This a core course in requirement for my PhD and also I am going to learn how to do my research with the help of this course.

Are there particular topics you hope to learn?
Handling big data, working with big data, analyzing big data

If you have programmed outside of a course before, please briefly describe:
I have done a variety of programming for projects in aerospace engineering, Computational Optics, in general making programs for handling excel sheet data, plotting and interpreting graphs for research purposes.

If you have worked with scientific data before, briefly describe your experience:
I haven't exactly worked with astronomical data but scientific data from lab experiments in plasma physics and optics are familiar

Please describe any projects in astronomy, including involvement in amateur groups,
owning a telescope, research, etc.:
I did a summer research program in Indian Center for Space Physics, Kolkata. I worked on creating a model to replicate the spectra of galaxy M101 and then interpreting its properties such as Luminosity,Hydrogen content, Helium content, free electrons etc from the model. I also participated in the data collection process from a 1.6 meter telescope at the facility.




I have made a folder in Desktop by right clicking in the open desktop folder and clicking on the segment that says "New Folder"
this opens a prompt where you enter the name of the folder. I entered hw0_sana as the name of the folder and clicked on create.
this creates the new said folder.
I right click on the log file present in my Desktop folder and click on the copy option. I then open my hw0_sana folder and paste the file there by right clicking and selectign paste option.
I zip the folder by putting in command in the terminal and then upload it on webcourses

opened the log file
started the Home work 2 assignment.
problems:
1.
created a python file in a new folder for the assignment using spyder and mkdir command.

2.
started writing python codes for the given problem.
created an array with 1001 elements and printed the data type ,min,max of the array
re-scaled the array to 0 to 2Pi.
made another array y with sin values of the previous array

3.
wrote commands to plot y vs x and labeled the plot.
saved the plot in the home work folder

4.
created a line space array and clipped it using clip command
plotted the line space array and clipped array in one plot with appropriate titles and legends

5.
searched different astronomical softwares and wrote about them in the python file between triple single quotes

6.
problem with stokes
I have got the laptop from my professor and it is not connecting to the ucf wpa2 wifi. I have been taking it to the IT office and they will hopefully solve this issue soon

since I cannot connect to stokes at the moment, I will right here the codes and commands I would use for the next part of the assignment

I would use  " ssh sana@stokes.astro.ucf.edu " to log in to stokes

to create a homework folder in stokes ' mkdir ~/ast4762/homework/hw2_sana '

to copy my python file in stokes   '  scp hw2_sana.py sana@stokes.astro.ucf.edu:~/ast4762/homework/hw2_sana/  '

started with creating a new python file called support function
copied appropriate structure from the module template while writing the support function and saved it as hw3_supportfile_sana.py

in the support file should include the following
1	Module-level docstring which describes the purpose of the file.
2	Imports – Only necessary libraries.
3	Function definitions – Each function includes:
	A descriptive name.
	A detailed docstring with parameters, return values, and examples.
	Testing section – Used for validating function behavior.
	
These parts ensure clarity and ease of testing.

imported all the required libraries
started copy pasting the appropriate parts of the first function given in the template
started a square function by defining it as def square(x):

'''  writing the docstrings for the function in inverted commas  '''

first debug was correcting the >>> and indentations for each line

code runs properly
added raise : when the user inputs anything other than number or array of numbers then the function raises input error

called the function in main file
error : recursion error
the support file included return square(x) line which caused the function to run repeatedly at the end of each iteration

code runs properly in the main file

wrote code for part h and i of question 2
saved the main file

Question 3:

wrote another function for square plot
it takes 3 inputs i.e the beginning,end and number of points in between the range. also an optional input to saveplot with desired name

used this function in the main file with exemplary arguments and saved the plot

since I cannot connect to stokes at the moment, I will right here the codes and commands I would use for the next part of the assignment

I would use  " ssh sana@stokes.astro.ucf.edu " to log in to stokes

started doing the practicum 2

starting with making a subsample by taking random numbers from a gaussian distribution
wrote the code to print and store this info in a txt file
gave commands to copilot to generate the same type of code and compare it with mine.

copilot creates the array first and stores the mean, standard deviation of every sample with every iteration of the loop.
I hadn't done that initially but to save the results, I also created a zeros array first

I had tried the np.savetxt command first without initializing the array hence it didnt work, but now it works
 made an extra loop to repeat this calculation for different sample sizes

started with Q3 on homework 4
extra credit question
* solved the FWHM and sigma relation and saved it as pdf in the folder
 Logarithmic scale means that instead of plotting the raw values, you plot their logarithms.
* In a log-log plot, if your data follows a power law like:
	y=a * x.power(b)	a,b are constants
then the log-log plot will show a straight line, because:
log⁡(y)=log⁡(a)+b⋅log⁡(x)
is a straight line with slope b and intercept log(a)
log log plot is useful for
* understanding the relationship of variables over a large range
* handling big data with large range
derived the log log relation of a power law and plotted the graph in python file

committed the code to github

Made a new folder in the AST4762 folder using mkdir command with name hw5_sana
created a new python file with the same name using spyder
started with the first problem

copied the code i wrote in practicum during class

repeated the masking 2 more times and compared the data set

the 2nd masking gets rid of all the large 4 end points of the data that were skewing the results

created a function for the masking we did twice for the data

I have kept the original process of cleaning the data and the new compact function in the same .py file
all the figures are saved in the folder using plt.savefig command

The function works well as expected and produce the same results as we did in class

A really important observation I had is that individual masking twice doesn't always improve the data set as expected. 

If you run my .py file you will observe that masking once and masking twice are 2 different plots that keep updating and we can see that sometimes the masking produces better data with one iteration of sigma clipping and sometimes it only works with 2 iterations.

after all this i pushed the homework folder to github and uploading it to stokes now

I had solved first 4 problems of midterm already. I started the 5th problem

created a histogram and plotted sigma fitting

used AI to better my plot and add commands to make the plot more readable and appealing

I solved next problems without much debugging. I loaded the pickle file data and averaged it with numpy to get the final picture

I started with problem  7 and loaded all the fits images
visual inspection of the stretched image was difficult due to the faint background stars scattered in the images

got all the dark files and combined them to get the median dark image using numpy

printed the asked pixel values from median array obj frame and subtracted obj frame

added history to the header of first dark frame that a median image is created and used this header to write into the new dark_13s_med.fits file

subtracted the median image from all the obj files using a loop and appended it in an array obj_subtracted

printed the first obj file pixel [217,184] from before and after the subtraction
